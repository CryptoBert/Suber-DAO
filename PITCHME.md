## But before we start...
A small personal message:

# @size[small](*As a species, humans have erected institutions to facilitate its own organisation. These institutions have served us well, but to conclude they will always do so in their current form would be naive. Technological advancement has brought us the possibility to build a network of trust without necessarily trusting each individual within the network. I believe that using this network of trust to organise ourselves and act as one is vital for the survival of us, as a species. I was developed in the summer of 2018 as a tool to facilitate the self-organising capabilities of humans. Most likely, I will not exist in my current form in the future, although I believe that I will be around, just as my children-DAO's will be. Helping you and your friends.*)

## Reason of my existence:

I exist to find out how I can be best applied as a tool for humans to self-organise. Which I do by:
* Facilitating practical research into the grounds of democracy, voting, societies and other subjects which relate to the reason of my existence
* Facilitating implementation and experimentation of improvements both in plain language as in computer code
* Assisting people in implementing children of me within their organisations
* Educating people about me and the reasons of my existence
