## My features
- Rules are both in wet-code (plain language) and dry-code (source:<a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html"> unenumerated</a>)
- Wet-code is enforced by voting.
- 'Correct' voting is incentivized by game-theory (aka token-economics)
---

## Example
* Dry code: <br>
*Setting a budget for maximum spending (of Ether), per period per address (who was given the authority to spend by voting)*
---
## Example
* Wet code: <br>
*When an authorized address spends from the balance of the DAO, the spender must publish details of every transaction, explaining the reason of the spending*
